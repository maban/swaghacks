# Swag Hacks

## Setup

If you want to get this repo running locally on your machine, you’ll need to get set up with Jekyll.

To install Jekyll, open up your command line and type…

```
gem install jekyll
```

…then…

```
jekyll serve
```

…to get the server address where the static files are built.

Hacks go in the `_hack` folder.
